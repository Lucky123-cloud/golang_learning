Golang Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my journey in learning and mastering the Go programming language. It covers key concepts, projects, and examples that demonstrate my understanding of Go’s core principles and backend development capabilities.

What I’m Learning

Go Basics: syntax, variables, constants, data types, and control structures.

Functions and Packages: defining functions, using standard libraries, and structuring reusable packages.

Structs and Interfaces: implementing custom types, methods, and polymorphism using interfaces.

Concurrency: working with goroutines, channels, and synchronization mechanisms for efficient parallelism.

Error Handling: managing and propagating errors using Go’s idiomatic error patterns.

File Handling and I/O: reading, writing, and managing files in Go.

Web Development: building simple REST APIs using Go’s net/http package.

Database Integration: connecting Go applications to relational databases using SQL drivers.

Testing: writing and running unit tests using Go’s built-in testing tools.

Performance Optimization: analyzing and improving code performance using Go’s profiling tools.

Goal

To gain hands-on experience building robust, scalable, and efficient backend systems using Go, preparing for professional backend development and system-level programming opportunities.
